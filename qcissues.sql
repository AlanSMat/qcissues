', 1, '32', 'Hi Lee, After reviewing the check copies from the Macarthur run, the following issues were observed. 1. The whole run is in some way affected by registration issues on page 46 and 47. 2. In reviewing the pages across the plate cylinder, printers had the registration on page 6 (full page ad) right, but it was forcing page 46 and 47 out of registration at the 20,000 or 20:52 check copy. 3. At the 30,000 or 21:13 check copy the registration improves on page 46 and 47 for the remainder of the run. The check copies were reviewed by Todd (C Line Production Leader). Todd will be discussing this registration complaint with his team, and looking at ways to improve the quality in the future. As part of the learning experience from this complaint, could you please let us know the impact to the business, so it also can be discussed with the team? The issue with the plate benders on Line 2, 3 and 4, that the site had a few months ago has been resolved. Line 1 is still out of production and receiving repairs. At present however, there are several units within the press hall that require blankets to be redressed. Loose, old or a mix of old and new blankets on a print unit will cause registration issues. units redressed in a timely manner. Regards,\r\nIan', 'Closed', '', '', '0', '0', '1', 1, 0),

Open the jaw settings which will decrease the amount of pressure applied to the fold. However, there’s a very fine line. Opening the jaw setting to far, could result in the book coming free of the jaw and causing a folder jam. At speed these jams can cause lengthy delays, due to the repairs involved.  \r\n2.	Positioning and size of the advert. Obviously this would be out of SPC’s hands.      \r\n3.	Reduced ink density. Again, this is a very fine line, as reducing ink could affect the advert itself and the collect pages.\r\n\r\nThere’s also a few ways to combat creasing.\r\n1.	Folder former settings can be adjusted to allow more or less support on the webs as the book travels into the folder.\r\n2.	Increased web tensions, due to The Australian’s complex job build (two book production), the turn web can lose tension causing web to crease.  \r\nAlso, in the past all Breitling and high profile adverts were flagged with SPC production so extra focus could be placed on the production. Would it be possible for a notification email to be sent in regards to upcoming productions?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nIan     \r\n', 'Closed', '', '40,071', '0', '0', '0', 1, 0),
